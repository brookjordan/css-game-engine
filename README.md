# CSS Game Engine
A game engine for creating web-based games that compile to only CSS and HTML. ie: no JavaScript.

Currently totally work in progress with many parts waaaaay too coupled, and others waaaaay too wet.

## To compile

Compile all `.pug` files in-place with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) and all `.scss` files in-place with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## To run

After compiling, open `index.html` in your favourite (up-to-date) browser.
